# Stock-Price-Prediction
Abstract


This research paper presents a decision-support framework for invest-
ment in the stock market with unexpected incidents. The data used for
the study are energy resource stocks with incidences that affected the
Japan exchange group market in 2017-2020. Multiple attributes of the
data were considered in the analysis, including stock price volatility and
closing price moving averages. The best relevant features were chosen
by using feature engineering techniques. Three low-risk stocks with ex-
pected high returns, selected using Markowitz Modern Portfolio theory,
were used for the prediction. A multivariate prediction model based
on the Long Short-Term Memory network was developed to predict the
closing prices of these three energy stocks with incidences. The effective-
ness of the proposed prediction model was evaluated using a standard
measurement metric, the Root Mean Square error. The results indicate
that the proposed framework is an effective decision-support tool for day
traders.
